# AWS Instructor-Led Lab

## Overview

If you are attending an AWS hosted event, you will have access to an AWS account with any optional pre-provisioned infrastructure and IAM policies needed to complete this workshop. The goal of this section is to help you access this AWS account. You may skip this section if you plan to use your own AWS account.

## Prerequisites

* Access to the 12 digit event access code distributed by an event operator as part of an AWS hosted event.
* Sign in via [the Event Engine url](https://dashboard.eventengine.run/) or the one-click join event link provided by the event operator.

* Click `Join event`.

## Best Practices

* Review the terms and conditions of the event. Do not upload any personal or confidential information in the account.
* The AWS account will only be available for the duration of this workshop and you will not be able to retain access after the workshop is complete. Backup any materials you wish to keep access to after the workshop.
* Any pre-provisioned infrastructure will be deployed to a specific region. Check your workshop content to determine whether other regions will be used.

## Accessing your AWS Account

After joining the event, you should see the page with event information and workshop details. You should also see a section titled "AWS account access" on the left navigation bar. You can use these options to access the temporary AWS account provided to you. Click on `Open AWS console` link on the bottom left.

The AWS Console will open in another tab or window.

This account will expire at the end of the workshop and all the resources created will be automatically deprovisioned. You will not be able to access this account after today.
