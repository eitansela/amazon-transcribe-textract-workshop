For a Transcribe Immersion Day, where you need to use your own AWS accounts. Follow the below best practices:

*   Use a AWS account that is not running production systems.
* Costs will be incurred for the duration of the workshop.
*   Any accounts should be created a minimum of three days ahead of time. It takes time for new accounts to be completely ready, payment methods to be confirmed, and limits to be set.
