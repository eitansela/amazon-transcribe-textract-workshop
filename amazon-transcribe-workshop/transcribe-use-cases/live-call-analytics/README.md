# Live Call Analytics

Your contact center connects your business to your community, enabling customers to order products, callers to request support, clients to make appointments, and much more. When calls go well, callers retain a positive image of your brand, and are likely to return and recommend you to others. And the converse, of course, is also true.

Naturally, you want to do what you can to ensure that your callers have a good experience. There are two aspects to this:

- Help supervisors assess the quality of your caller's experiences in real time - For example, your supervisors need to know if initially unhappy callers become happier as the call progresses. And if not, why? What actions can be taken, before the call ends, to assist the agent to improve the customer experience for calls that aren't going well?
- Help agents optimize the quality of your caller's experiences - For example, can you deploy live call transcription or AI powered agent assistance? This removes the need for your agents to take notes, and provides them with contextually relevant information and guidance during calls, freeing them to focus more attention on providing positive customer interactions.

Amazon machine learning services like Amazon Transcribe and Amazon Comprehend provide feature-rich APIs that you can use to transcribe and extract insights from your contact center audio at scale. Amazon Lex provides conversational AI capabilities that can capture intents and context from conversations, and Amazon Kendra offers intelligent search features that can provide useful information to agents based on callers' needs. Although you could build your own custom call analytics solution using these services, that requires time and resources. You figure that someone must have done this before, and that with luck youâ€™ll find a solution that you can re-use.

Live Call Analytics with Agent Assist (LCA), does most of the heavy lifting associated with providing an end-to-end solution that can plug into your contact center and provide the intelligent insights that you need.
